## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

### Layered Structure

```
Request → Routes → Services → Database
                      ↓
                   Models ← Types
```

### Separation of Concerns

- **Routes** - Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services** - Contain business logic
- **Database** - Handle data persistence
- **Models** - Define data structures
- **Types** - Type definitions
- **Config** - Application configuration

## ✨ Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ RESTful API design
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Input validation ready
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Filtering and sorting
- ✅ Type safety throughout
- ✅ Clean code principles
- ✅ SOLID principles
- ✅ DRY principle

## 🧪 Testing Ready

The structure supports easy testing:

- Services can be unit tested in isolation
- Routes can be integration tested
- Database can be mocked for testing
- Clear separation makes testing straightforward

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The application includes:

- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Database initialization
- ✅ Data seeding
- ✅ Clean shutdown handling
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Production build setup
